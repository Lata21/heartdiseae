Heart Disease Prediction
Overview
This is a Python-based project that aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical and lifestyle attributes. The prediction is made using machine learning techniques on a dataset containing historical records of patients and their corresponding heart disease status.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [XYZ Dataset Repository] (Provide the source/link to the dataset). It contains information on various medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant features. The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease, where 1 represents the presence, and 0 represents the absence.

Installation
To use this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Model Performance
Our heart disease prediction model has been trained on a labeled dataset with a split of 80% training data and 20% testing data. The current model has achieved an accuracy of approximately X% on the test set. (You can provide additional evaluation metrics if applicable, such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)

Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve this heart disease prediction project. If you find any issues or want to add new features, feel free to create a pull request. Additionally, for major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
